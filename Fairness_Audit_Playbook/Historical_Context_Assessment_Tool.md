## Historical Context Assessment Tool

### 1. Introduction

The Historical Context Assessment Tool is a reusable framework that helps **identify historically rooted fairness risks early—before they are embedded in system design, data pipelines, or optimization goals**. By focusing on root causes such as historical power structures, institutional practices, and representational choices, it shifts fairness assessment from a post-hoc check to a foundational design practice.

As the first component of the Fairness Audit Playbook, the tool is used prior to finalizing data collection and model training, and its outputs guide later decisions on fairness definitions, metrics, data audits, and mitigation strategies.

### 2. Assignment Context

I work as a staff engineer at a technology company deploying AI systems across multiple products. An engineering team is scoping an AI-powered internal loan application system that enables users to purchase products and pay in installments.

The team recognizes that lending-related systems are historically sensitive and has requested support in identifying fairness risks early in development. Initial discussions reveal that a purely technical audit would be insufficient without understanding the historical context of financial discrimination.

I propose developing a structured tool that:
- Guides teams through historically informed analysis
- Translates social and historical insights into concrete technical risks
- Fits within standard engineering workflows.  

Recognizing that this challenge applies broadly across teams and domains, I formalized this approach as the Historical Context Assessment Tool (HCAT).

## 3. Objectives

- Translating historical discrimination research into actionable engineering methodology
- Mapping historical patterns to specific AI system risks
- Communicating societal and historical issues to technical audiences
- Balancing analytical rigor with practical usability in business environments

## 4. Requirements Overview

The Historical Context Assessment Tool includes four components:

**1. Structured Questionnaire**  
Identifies historically relevant discrimination patterns and their mechanisms.

**2. Risk Classification Matrix** 
Prioritizes risks based on severity, likelihood, and relevance.

**3. User Documentation**  
Guides teams on when and how to apply the tool.

**4. Applied Case Study**  
Demonstrates use of the tool for an internal loan application system.
