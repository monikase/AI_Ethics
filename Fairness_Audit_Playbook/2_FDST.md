# Fairness Definition Selection Tool

## 1. Introduction

The Fairness Definition Selection Tool helps systematically **select appropriate fairness definitions for their AI systems** based on application context, historical patterns, stakeholder priorities, legal requirements, and technical constraints.

Because different fairness definitions reflect different philosophical principles and are often mathematically incompatible, selecting a definition is not a purely technical decision.  
This tool ensures that fairness metric selection is explicit, justified, and documented rather than assumed or inherited from default practices.

As the second component of the Fairness Audit Playbook, the tool is applied after the Historical Context Assessment and before model optimization.

## 2. Objectives
- Translate abstract fairness definitions into practical selection criteria
- Map application characteristics to appropriate fairness definitions
- Make fairness trade-offs explicit and documented
- Align fairness metric selection with legal and ethical constraints
- Provide a structured method for navigating incompatibilities

## 3. Tool Overview
The Fairness Definition Selection Tool consists of four components:
1. **Fairness Definition Catalog**  
A concise reference of key fairness definitions, their mathematical formulations, philosophical foundations, and appropriate use cases.

2. **Definition Selection Decision Tree**  
A structured process for mapping application context to fairness definitions.

3. **Trade-Off Analysis Template**  
A documentation framework for recording selection rationale and acknowledging incompatibilities.

4. **Applied Example**  
A worked example demonstrating tool usage for an internal loan application system.
