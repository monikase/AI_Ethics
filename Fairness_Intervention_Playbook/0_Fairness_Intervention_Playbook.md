# Fairness Intervention Playbook
### Organizational Framework for Systematic AI Fairness Intervention

## 1. Introduction

The **Fairness Intervention Playbook** is a practical decision-making guide for choosing and evaluating technical fairness interventions.  

It helps you:  
- **Turn diagnosis into action** - move from audit findings to concrete solutions
- **Select the right intervention point** - data, model, or post-processing
- **Match techniques to specific bias patterns**
- **Combine multiple approaches when needed**
- **Align interventions with your fairness definitions and constraints**

Rather than offering one universal fix, the playbook guides you through a structured selection process based on:  

- Your defined fairness criteria
- The bias sources you identified
- Your technical and operational limitations

Think of it as your **fairness treatment plan** - a customized approach to addressing the exact disparities you’ve diagnosed.

## 2. Playbook Overview

The Playbook consists of four integrated components:

1. Causal Fairness Toolkit ([CFT]())
2. Pre-Processing Fairness Toolkit ([PPFT]())
3. In-Processing Fairness Toolkit ([IPFT]())
4. Post-Processing Fairness Toolkit ([POSTPFT]())

Each component builds on the last: causal analysis identifies where intervention will be most effective, guiding whether to adjust the data, model, or outputs.
