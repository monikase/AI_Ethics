# Fairness Intervention Playbook
### Organizational Framework for Systematic AI Fairness Intervention

## 1. Introduction

The **Fairness Intervention Playbook** is a practical decision-making guide for choosing and evaluating technical fairness interventions.

It helps you:
**- Turn diagnosis into action** — move from audit findings to concrete solutions
**- Select the right intervention point** — data, model, or post-processing
**- Match techniques to specific bias patterns**
- Combine multiple approaches when needed
- Align interventions with your fairness definitions and constraints

Rather than offering one universal fix, the playbook guides you through a structured selection process based on:

- Your defined fairness criteria
- The bias sources you identified
- Your technical and operational limitations

Think of it as your fairness treatment plan — a customized approach to addressing the exact disparities you’ve diagnosed.
